This is a very simple Bomberman clone!

**YOUR MISSION**
- We leave for 30 minutes. Your Mission:
    - For all players except player 1, implement some kind of AI. Use your creativity, but here are some ideas to think about:
        - Characters should wander towards a nearby player.
        - Characters should plant a bomb if it's going to hit another player.
        - If a character sees they're about to get hit by a bomb, they should attempt to avoid it.
    - ALSO: As you go about your tasks, look for stuff you don’t like about the current architecture, if you were to build this into a more fully featured game. Keep this in mind, as we’ll be asking about it after.
